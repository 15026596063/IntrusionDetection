# IntrusionDetection
Implementation of different machine learning algorithms to find the best predictor of Intrusion Detection.

 
Abstractâ€”The tremendous growth of internet-based traffic exposes corporate networks for wide variety of vulnerabilities. Intrusive traffics are affecting the smooth operation of network infrastructure by consuming corporate resources and time.  Efficient way of protection, identification and mitigation from intrusive incidents enhance productivity. Intrusion Detection system (IDS) is one of the key components of network traffic security.  IDS solution can be host based or network based to fully oversee intrusive traffic in the network. Efficient automated detection techniques of anomaly traffic are improving over time. This research aims to find the best classifier that detects anomaly traffic from NSL-KDD dataset with high accuracy level and minimal error rate by experimenting with different machine learning methods. Five binary classifiers: Stochastic Gradient Decent, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Sequential Model in Keras are tested and validated to come up with the result. The results demonstrated that Random Forest Classifier outperformed the other four classifiers with and without passing through data normalization process.
